<h1> E-Commerce Sales Prediction Using Random Forest Regression: WGU MSDA Capstone Project</h1>
<br>
<h2> Project Description/Purpose</h2>
<br>
E-commerce sales of products are influenced by the product's star rating, number of reviews, best seller status, and price <a href="https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02277-7">(Sung et al., 2023).</a> The purpose of this project was to analyze customer purchase data of pet-related products on a popular e-commerce platform, and using that data build a random forest regression model that could predict product sales with an accuracy of at least 70%.
<br>
<h2> Tools Used For Analysis</h2>
<br>
<b>Data:</b> The data used for this analysis consited of 1,735,414 entries of products sold on an e-commerce platform. The dataset is ODC Attribution Licensed and made available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/usa-optimal-product-price-prediction">Kaggle.com</a> by the user Asaniczka. The data were filtered to contain pet-related product observations of star rating, number of reviews, price, best-seller status, and the number of products purchased in the prior month. This provided 5,432 observations for the regression model.
<br>
<br>
All parts of this analysis were conducted using Python in a Jupyter notebook. The Python libraries and modules used for this analysis included:
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Pandas</li>
	<li>Numpy</li>
	<li>Matplotlib.pyplot</li>
	<li>Seaborn</li>
	<li>Scipy.stats</li>
	<li>Scikit-Learn</li>
</ul>

<h2> Additional Notes</h2>
<br>
Since this was my graduate capstone project for WGU, I had to follow specific guidelines regarding the project's scope and format. I'd like to revisit this project in the future to see if a more accurate predictive model could be built. In this follow-up project, I'd like to:
<ol>
	<li>Use more data</li>
	<li>Try other regression models, such as XGBoost</li>
</ol>
